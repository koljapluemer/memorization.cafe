# Step 10: Settings Page Placeholder

## Overview
Create a simple placeholder page for Settings (to be implemented later).

## Architecture Rules
- Location: `src/pages/settings/`
- Minimal content, just a placeholder

## Tasks

### 10.1 Create Settings Page

Create `src/pages/settings/SettingsPage.vue`:

```vue
<template>
  <div class="max-w-2xl mx-auto">
    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Settings</h1>
    <p class="text-gray-500">Settings page coming soon.</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
// Placeholder - no logic needed yet
</script>
```

## File Structure

```
src/pages/settings/
└── SettingsPage.vue
```

## Validation

- [ ] Page loads without errors
- [ ] Shows placeholder text
- [ ] ESLint passes

## Final Steps

After completing all 10 steps:

1. **Run Linter**: `npm run lint` and ensure it passes
2. **Test All Features**:
   - Create collections
   - Add flashcards and concepts
   - Practice items
   - Edit and delete items
   - Use filters on practice page
   - Verify localStorage persistence for filters
3. **Check Responsive Design**: Test on mobile and desktop
4. **Verify Architecture**: Ensure folder structure follows Feature-Sliced Design
5. **Review Code Quality**: Short functions, single responsibility, clean code

## Project Complete!

All core features are now implemented:
- Collections management
- Simple Flashcards with ts-fsrs spaced repetition
- Elaborative Interrogation Concepts
- Practice page with random selection and filtering
- Manage page with full CRUD operations
- Settings placeholder

Future enhancements can include:
- Dexie Cloud sync setup
- Realm-based sharing
- Additional learning item types
- Statistics and progress tracking
- Settings page implementation
